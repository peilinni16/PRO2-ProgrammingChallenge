The main program is located in the module program.cc. To store and treat the data described in the statement of the practice, we will use the module species to represent the species are their identifiers and genes, the module cjt_species to represent a set of species where we will store the distances between species i the set. For clusters we will use the module cluster i the module cjt_clusters to store a set of these.
